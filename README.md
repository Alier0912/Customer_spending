##  Spending Patterns Dataset
  
### Dataset Overview

- The Spending Patterns Dataset provides a synthetic representation of consumer spending  behaviour  across various categories.

- This dataset is ideal for exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, and machine learning applications related to financial forecasting, customer segmentation, or consumer behaviour analysis.
 
----------------- 
*DATA GATHERING*
    
- Our data was sourced from Kaggle Dataset. Our data consist of 9 columns and 10,000 rows of data.

- The data consists of 200 unique customer IDS which records their entire information linking up the 8 columns to the customer ID column.

- Our data is not that clean, some few incosistencies like total Spent column not adding to the multiplication of quantity purchased and Price per unit,

- Also the location column brings ambiguous meaning as it contain (Mobile App, In-store and Online), hence renaming the location column to Channel.

------

**DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION**

- We had to multiply the unit price by quantity purchased to get the correct Total spent per customer.

- We also renamed the location columns to channel to remove ambiguity.

- We came up with few more columns ;

- we obtained the month and day of transaction from the date of transaction column ,
we did so for easy

- Manipulation of our data to find specific trends in our customers' purchases on a monthly and daily basis.

- I also introduced a season column to segment our dataset for trend across different season to monitor their journey ,lastly I introduced the 

- Average Order Value for the analysis and segmentation of customers according to their value of purchases on different categories
 
**DATA VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS**

. Category-Specific KPIs:

	• Average Order Value (AOV): Track the average amount spent per transaction within each category.
 
	• This helps you understand which categories drive higher spending and identify potential for upselling or cross-selling.

	• Basket Analysis: Analyze the composition of customer shopping baskets to understand how customers combine products from different categories. 
 
	• This can inform product placement, promotions, and recommendations
  

**Channel-Specific KPIs:**

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The  average order value (AOV) of top 4 categories include: shopping, groceries, food and fitness , the following categories are known to be essential categories,
2. 
   hence its evident that our customers buy first essential categories . Bundling products within the named categories would elevate the shopping experience of 
 customers leading to more purchases.

4. Category profitability - Shopping, housing & utilities, fitness and medical/dental are the top 5 most profitable categories( in that order) but shopping stood out , as 
   most customers were shopping . Target marketing campaigns and discount for more customer interaction.
   
6. Online was the most used channel by customers , followed closely by mobile app , making easy and simple website and mobile app or updating them , would keep   
    interaction high with shopping customers and wholly improve their shopping experience by ensuring easy and understandable checkouts, securing the customer 
  information and employing bots to make shopping easier for customers.

8. Frequency of purchases - Dental visit, coffee, workout equipment, fast food and dinner with friends were the top 5  in terms of number of times purchased, we can
  conclude that our customers are putting the essential products before purchasing other products .

10. Spend over time - Based on monthly spend, the line chart is not always in one constant trend, we can clearly observe change of spend at different times .March
  to May saw cutting on spending and from August to the end of year saw increase  in spending until the year ends. Using the data , proper strategy like proper price
  evaluation with economic conditions and targeted to reduce customer churn
